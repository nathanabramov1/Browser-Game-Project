The game that is being played is Tic Tac Toe. its a game that everyone knows and loves to play. 

i used the github repository that panos our previous instuctor gave to us as a source - https://github.com/thepeekay/simple-javascript-games

The insperation for the styling of the game came from https://codepen.io/ArmandoAmador/pen/AEdQBG

This is a two player game, to play u can click on an empty box then ur apponent will make there move until there is either a winner or it will be declared a tie. 

there was one section in the game that i had trouble with so i contacted a freind of mine who graduated from the NYU bootcamp and he helped me. I mentioned his name and where he helped me in the javascript code (its commented )
